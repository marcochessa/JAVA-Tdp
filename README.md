# JAVA-Tdp

The Java-Tdp repository is dedicated to the Java Programming course, which aims to enhance students' programming skills, enabling them to tackle and solve complex application problems through the development of software applications. This course builds upon the knowledge acquired in previous courses, particularly Object-Oriented Programming and Databases, empowering students to create comprehensive applications with graphical user interfaces and relational database access.

## Course Objectives

- **Java Programming Complements**: The course covers topics such as graphic applications using JavaFX, database access with JDBC, and main programming patterns including MVC, Singleton, Factory, and DAO.
- **Data Structures**: Students learn about various data structures such as lists, trees, graphs, and priority queues. The course also includes Java libraries for managing complex data structures, such as jGraphT.
- **Algorithms**: Algorithmic concepts covered include recursion, recursive optimization, search algorithms, and graph algorithms. Students explore event simulation techniques as well.
- **Problem Solving**: The course delves into research problems and optimization problems, teaching exhaustive (recursive) search techniques. Applications to real-world managerial scenarios are also explored.
