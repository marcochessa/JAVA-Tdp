# JAVA-Tdp
The course aims at complementing the programming abilities of the students, allowing them to face and solve application problems, even complex ones, through the development of software applications. In particular, the course integrates the skills acquired in former courses, in particular Object Oriented Programming and Data Bases, enabling students to create complete applications with graphical user interfaces and that access relational data bases. From the algorithmic point of view, after introducing recursion, the most common data structures (lists, trees, graphs) will be analyzed, and the most relevant simulation and optimization algorithms will be studied, in particular with concrete applications to the fields of logistics, production, and enterprise organization (e.g., resource allocation, scheduling, queuing network systems, transports, etc.).

Repo arguments:
* Java programming complements: graphic applications (JavaFX), access to databases (JDBC), main programming patterns (MVC, Singleton, Factory, DAO).
* Data structures: lists, trees, graphs, priority queues, Java libraries for managing complex data structures (jGraphT).
* Algorithms: recursion, recursive optimization, search and search procedures, in graphs, event simulation.
* Problem solving: 
  * research problems and optimization problems; 
  * exhaustive (recursive) search techniques; 
  * applications to cases of managerial interest
